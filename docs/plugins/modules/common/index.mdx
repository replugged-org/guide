import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";

Replugged comes with a bunch of modules that are commonly used. You can access them with:

```ts
import { common } from "replugged";
```

:::warning

Your editor may suggest importing a module directly from within `replugged/dist/whatever`, but this
will not work. You should always import from `replugged` itself and destructure the module you want.

:::

:::tip

You can access common modules in Discord DevTools with `replugged.common`.
